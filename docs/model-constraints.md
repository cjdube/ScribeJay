# Writing code against a small local model

*Mirrored byte-for-byte from LocalLLMAgent's `docs/model-constraints.md` — this file's twin. Applies equally to Wren and ScribeJay; the same failure modes hit both.*

Wren's on-device model is small. Four failure modes have each cost weeks of
silent breakage, and each one produced a rule in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)'s *Small-local-model constraints* section.

AGENTS.md carries the rule and the measured result, because that's what's
needed while writing code. This file carries the evidence — the incidents, the
replay counts, the reasoning — because that's what's needed when someone is
about to decide the rule doesn't apply to their case. It usually does.

The four share a shape worth naming up front: **the failure is invisible.** In
every case the model returned something well-formed, the task exited 0, and no
alert fired. Nothing looked wrong until someone went looking.

## `think=False` for template-filling calls

**Rule:** pass `think=False` for any call that fills in a template — a
classification, a score, a fixed output format. Pass `logger=` too.

The model's thinking tokens come out of the same `num_predict` budget as its
answer. A call that reasons too long doesn't return a truncated answer — it
returns **empty content**, and the caller reports it as a parse failure. The
symptom points at parsing; the cause is budget.

**Incidents.** Twice: `calendar_colorizer` crashed on an empty response, and
`opportunity_digest` silently emailed 11 unscored leads.

**Measured**, on 40-lead scoring:

| | Runs producing output | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| thinking on | 0 of 3 | — |
| thinking off | 3 of 3 | 5x faster |

**Where thinking stays on:** only where the model must reason past what the
prompt already contains — `evaluate_app`, `daily_synthesis`. Measure even
there.

**What "measure even there" turned up.** `daily_synthesis` lost its output to
this in **3 of its first 29 runs** (2026-08-02, -08-12, -08-14) — each time
discarding candidates that had already matched. It isn't prompt size: the
smallest of the three carried 15 signals, the largest 46. It is
nondeterministic — 2026-08-14 returned nothing, then returned nudges on the
next call with an identical prompt — so the fix there is
`MAX_SYNTHESIS_ATTEMPTS = 2`, not `think=False`, which would trade an occasional
empty answer for a permanently worse one. The retry warns even when it
succeeds; a silent self-healing retry would hide the failure rate, which is the
thing the section below exists to prevent.

**"Analysis" is not the test.** This is the part that gets rationalized away.
`evaluate_against` writes a judgement, which sounds like reasoning — but it
judges a target against standards that are *both already in the prompt*. That's
comparison, not chain-of-thought. With thinking on, 1 run in 3 returned
nothing; turning it off also made the output cite the standards more
specifically. `research` fills a seven-label template from supplied snippets —
same story, same fix.

The test is not "is this analysis?" but **"must the model reason past what the
prompt already contains?"**

**Logging:** `agent/loop.py` warns when a generation hits the cap, but only if
it has a logger. A call without `logger=` fails silently by construction.

**On Gemini:** only the Ollama path acts on `think`. The equivalent knob is
`WREN_GEMINI_THINKING_BUDGET` (already 0 by default, and some models reject 0 —
see `agent/backends/gemini.py`).

## Degrading on bad model output must be logged

**Rule:** if a parse yields fewer results than inputs — not just zero — log it
at WARNING with the counts and the raw length.

"Degrade, don't crash" is right for a dead feed, whose absence is obvious in
the resulting digest. Applied to model output it hides the bug instead, because
a digest with 8 of 10 leads looks exactly like a digest with 10.

**Incidents**, all silent for weeks:

- a mis-copied event id matched no event, so that event was never coloured
- `_parse_scores` returned `{}` and the digest emailed 11 leads scored 0
- a batch scoring 8 of 10 lost two leads with no trace

A scheduled task that silently produces *less* is worse than one that fails,
because only the failure pushes an alert.

## Catalogue tools must deny pretraining

**Rule:** a tool that answers "what exists?" must say in its description that
the answer is **not something the model knows**, that only what the tool
returns exists, and what to say when it returns nothing.

A catalogue question is the one shape where pretraining supplies a *plausible*
answer, so the model skips the tool and invents one. General knowledge contains
a perfectly good list of games; it just isn't ours.

**Incident.** Asked "let's play a game" — a request to act, not a question
about what exists — the `list_games` tool went uncalled in **2 of 12 replays**,
and Wren offered Wordle, Sudoku and Chess with fabricated links.

**Fix and result.** A description that only says *when* to call the tool isn't
enough. Rewriting it to deny pretraining explicitly took the replay to **12 of
12**. The wording is pinned by a test in `tests/test_games.py`.

**Verify with the vague phrasing.** "What games are there?" calls the tool
regardless; "let's play a game" is what exposed the gap.

Applies to any future registry-style tool — games, installed apps, connected
devices.

## Never tell the model to describe an action it should perform

**Rule:** any instruction about a confirmation-gated tool must say *call the
tool in the same turn*, and that the pause is the app's job — not a reason to
wait for a verbal go-ahead.

**Incident.** `agent/wren_chat.md` used to say a write should be narrated
because "the app itself will pause … so just narrate your intent." Asked to put
a fetched Strava activity on the calendar, the model replied:

> I'll add "Evening Volleyball" … from 6:38 PM to 9:13 PM

…and emitted no `tool_call`. 2 of 3 replays; `logs/wren.log` 2026-08-01 06:06.

`advance()` correctly ends the turn on a reply with no `tool_calls` — so
nothing was written, nothing was gated, and nothing was logged. A text-only
reply is shaped exactly like a legitimate answer. The user only noticed by
asking twice.

**Fix and result.** Rewording `wren_chat.md` to require the call in the same
turn took the replay to **9 of 9**.

**Backstop.** `chat/server.py:_warn_if_promised_without_acting` — a final reply
that promises an action while the turn executed no tool now logs a WARNING
instead of vanishing.

## Weekday arithmetic is date math — resolve it in Python

**Rule:** a tool that takes a day takes the user's *phrase* verbatim
(`'tomorrow'`, `'next tuesday'`, `'last friday'`) and resolves it in
`agent/dates.py`. Never ask the model which date a weekday falls on. A tool
whose answer depends on the day should also return the day it used, so the
reply quotes the tool rather than the model's memory.

**Incident.** Asked on Friday 2026-08-14 what was on the calendar for "next
Tuesday", the model looked up **08-19** — a Wednesday — found nothing, and
answered:

> You have nothing on your calendar for next Tuesday, August 19th.

The real next Tuesday, the 18th, had an event on it. `logs/wren.log` 2026-08-14
19:07.

**Why it was wrong shaped like right.** Nothing failed. The tool ran, returned
a valid empty list, and the prose agreed with the lookup — the model had simply
aimed both at the same wrong day. There is no error to log and no count to
compare, so none of the existing backstops could have caught it. Only someone
who knew the event existed would notice.

`resolve_date()` already owned `today`/`yesterday`/`MM-DD`/`YYYY-MM-DD` —
weekdays were the one date shape never moved into Python. Both instructions
pointed at the model asked for exactly the arithmetic it can't do:
`DATE_ARG_GUIDANCE` said "pass just 'MM-DD'" (a weekday phrase can't be passed,
so it had to convert), and the chat system prompt said to resolve "a relative
day … against today's date". A test even pinned the gap:
`resolve_date("next tuesday") == "next tuesday"`.

**Fix.** `_resolve_relative_day()` in `agent/dates.py` handles `tomorrow` and
weekday phrases, with `next`/`last` overriding the caller's `prefer` and a bare
weekday following it (Chrome history looks back, the calendar forward).
`DATE_ARG_GUIDANCE` was rewritten in the shape of `REMINDER_WHEN_GUIDANCE` —
pass verbatim, "do NOT work out the date yourself" — and its wording is pinned
by tests, because softening it back reintroduces the bug with every test green.
`get_events_by_date` now returns `resolved_start`/`resolved_end` and a human
`range`, and its schema tells the model to state that date.

**Result.** 3 of 3 replays correct, each passing `'next Tuesday'` through
verbatim; `tomorrow`, `last Friday` and a week-long range also correct.

**Two things the replay caught that the unit tests could not.** Building "the
week of next Monday", the model produced `'the following Sunday'` and `'the next
Sunday'` — filler forms now stripped — and then paired next Monday with the
*nearest* Sunday, the day before it. A backwards range returns nothing, which
reads exactly like a free week, so `get_events_by_date` rejects it outright.
Both are the same failure shape as the original: a plausible empty answer.

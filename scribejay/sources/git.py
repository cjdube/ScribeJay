"""Yesterday's commits, read out of the checkouts under PROJECTS_DIR.

The record already said WHEN the user worked (AI Session Time Blocks) and
what he READ (scribejay/daily_chrome_learnings.py). It did not say what he shipped.
Git is the only source that does.

Reading is local `git log`. One network call sits in front of it: fetch_repos()
runs `git fetch`, so a commit made on another machine and pushed is on this disk
before the day is scanned. Without it, work done anywhere but this Mac is absent
from the page and nothing says so — a quiet day and a lost day look identical.
The fetch is best-effort: an unreachable remote logs a WARNING and the day is
still written from what is already here.

Gather-only, the way agent/tools/chrome_history.py is for browsing. No model call
lives here (that is scribejay/daily_commits.py), and no TOOL_SCHEMA: Wren reads the
record ScribeJay writes, not the repos themselves.

Scope:
- `HEAD` plus the remote-tracking branches (`--remotes`) — where a commit fetched
  from another machine lands. Not `--all`, which would also fold in stale local
  branches and tags, whose rebase copies are commits nobody made that day.
- Merge commits are skipped — they carry no message worth journaling.
- Author-filtered, because a shared checkout's other contributors are not his day.

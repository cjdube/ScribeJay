"""Compose and write a daily YouTube-learnings review to the user's Obsidian vault
(one file per day). Non-interactive — run by launchd every morning, covering the
prior day's Liked videos.

The user deliberately Likes AI/tooling and product-management videos, so the day's
Likes are a clean signal for what he chose to learn. The model writes a short synthesis of what the videos
teach; a deterministic, scheme-validated linked list of the exact videos is
appended in Python. A day with no Likes writes nothing (keeps the vault clean).

Usage:
    python -m scribejay.daily_youtube_learnings

yesterday — the videos he chose to learn from. You are running unattended — infer everything from the data given.

Use EXACTLY this template, filling in the bracketed parts (do not add extra sections, do not
include the literal brackets):

## YouTube Learnings: [Month Date, Year]

### Themes Explored
- **[Theme/Tool]:** [What this cluster of videos teaches and how it could shape future work]

Rules:
- Write **2-4 bullets total** that GROUP the videos into themes — NOT one bullet per video. \
(Every video is already listed verbatim below your synthesis, so do not re-list them.)
- Bold the theme/tool at the start of each bullet.
- Professional, analytical tone. Explain what the cluster teaches and why it matters.
- Keep it tight — a few sentences per bullet. Never repeat a word or phrase.

Output ONLY the filled-in template text, nothing else — no preamble, no explanation.

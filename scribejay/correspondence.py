"""Yesterday's sent mail, turned into a record of who was written to.

The record says what he built (scribejay/daily_commits.py), what he read
(daily_chrome_learnings) and where his hours went (AI Session Time Blocks). None of it
says who he talked to. This is the only source that does.

**Metadata only.** `scribejay.sources.gmail_sent.fetch_sent_metadata` asks Gmail for
headers and nothing else, so the bodies are never fetched rather than fetched and
discarded. What is recorded is who, when, about what subject line, and whether it
was an answer or a decision to reach out.

**No model call**, and not for want of one: with no bodies, the model would have
only a subject and some names, and any sentence richer than those is invented. So
the page is assembled in Python, the way scribejay/strava_download.py maps Strava
fields onto calendar events without a natural-language step. The subject line the
user wrote is the most accurate description of the exchange that exists.

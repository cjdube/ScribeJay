"""Shared JSON-file store: resilient load, atomic write, cross-process lock.

Mirrors LocalLLMAgent's agent/store.py verbatim — ScribeJay's tasks and Wren's
both mutate config/*.json stores from separate processes, and this is the
same fcntl.flock-based guard against a lost update between them.

locked() closes that gap with fcntl.flock on a sidecar <name>.lock file. A
flock is held per open file description and every locked() call opens its own
fd, so it excludes concurrent threads and concurrent processes alike. The lock
lives on a sidecar rather than the store file itself because
atomic_write_json() replaces the store's inode via os.replace() — a lock taken
on the old inode would no longer exclude anyone after a write.

load_json() also absorbs a corrupt store file. A file that exists but won't
parse is moved aside to <name>.corrupt-<timestamp> for inspection, logged as
an error, and treated as the empty default.

Usage — hold the lock across the whole read-modify-write:

    with locked(STORE_PATH):
        data = load_json(STORE_PATH, {"jobs": []})
        data["jobs"].append(job)
        atomic_write_json(STORE_PATH, data)

Lock-free reads of an atomically-written file are safe (a reader sees the old
or the new complete file, never a torn one), so read-only paths may call
load_json() without locked() when a momentarily stale answer is acceptable.

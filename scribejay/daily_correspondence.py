"""Write a daily record of who was written to, into CORRESPONDENCE_DIR.

Non-interactive — run by launchd every morning, covering the prior day. Reads
Gmail's SENT metadata (headers only, never bodies) via
`scribejay.sources.gmail_sent.fetch_sent_metadata`, drops mail sent to the user
himself, groups the rest by conversation, and writes the page in Python.

**No model call.** With no bodies there is nothing to summarize that the subject
line does not already say, and a richer sentence would be invented — see
scribejay/correspondence.py. `scribejay/strava_download.py` is the other task
shaped this way.

**Not the vault's raw/.** These pages name people and the companies they work
for; the ingest queue would turn them into asserted wiki pages. See
`_correspondence_dir`.

Usage:
    python -m scribejay.daily_correspondence                 # yesterday
    python -m scribejay.daily_correspondence --date 2026-08-21
    python -m scribejay.daily_correspondence --backfill 14   # each of the last 14 days

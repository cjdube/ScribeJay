"""Log yesterday's AI session time as Google Calendar blocks.
Non-interactive — run by launchd every morning, covering the day that just ended.

The point is a calendar that records how the day actually went without anyone
remembering to fill it in. Claude Code and Codex Desktop both timestamp their local
session logs, so the hours are on disk; this task only has to decide where one
stretch of work ends and the next begins.

It pools EVERY session's events for the day and splits that single timeline on idle
gaps, rather than making one event per session. Sessions overlap constantly — one
measured day had eight session-days whose spans summed to ~19 hours against a real
~5 — so per-session events would triple-book the calendar. Pooling makes the
result non-overlapping by construction; a block that spans several repos names them
all.

Python owns the timeline, the rounding, the titles' structure and the descriptions;
the model only writes the phrase that says what the stretch was about.

Companion to scribejay/ai_chat_learnings.py, not part of it: the learnings review is
worth having whether or not you track time.

Usage:
    python -m scribejay.claude_time_blocks                    # yesterday
    python -m scribejay.claude_time_blocks --dry-run          # show the AI session blocks, write nothing
    python -m scribejay.claude_time_blocks --date 2026-08-05  # one specific day
    python -m scribejay.claude_time_blocks --backfill 7       # each of the last 7 days

Rules:
- ONE line, at most 60 characters. No trailing period.
- Say what was worked on, e.g. "fixed the login redirect loop" or "added weekly digest email".
- Do not name the project (it is already in the title) and do not mention the AI, the agent, or \
the session itself.
- Base it ONLY on the transcript. Do not invent work that isn't there.
